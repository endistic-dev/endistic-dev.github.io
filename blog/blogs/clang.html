            <b>The Beginning</b>
            <p>Hey everyone!
            <br>This is my first blog, about me learning C.
            <br>
            <br>C is a very... interesting language, to say the least.
            <br>Normally, programming languages give you a bunch of built-in
            <br>functions or data types. However, in C, you don't really get those
            <br>all too often. You mostly have to do it your self.
            <br>
            <br>This also includes, you guessed it, memory management!
            <br>You have to dictate how much memory some variables can take up,
            <br>and stuff like pointers and memory addresses. Crazy stuff, I know.
            <br>
            <br>In this blog, I will be documenting my experiences with C, and
            <br>linking some executable files alongside source code if you guys
            <br>want to try out some of the projects.
            <br>
            <br>This is my first time blogging, so bare with me if this
            <br>is gonna be a bad blog.
            <br>
            <br>Thanks for reading and have a good day!
            </p>
